## User story

As a manager at an internet retail company I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies.  So that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Acceptance criteria

- Given a functional Express.js API
- I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
- I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize when I enter schema and seed commands
- Then a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- I enter the command to invoke the application
- My server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
- I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
- Then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
